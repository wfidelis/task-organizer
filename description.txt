create an api that helps me organize my tasks throughout the day.
my app needs an inbox that takes all the tasks and i have and a description for them. It needs to have a time created as well as a time edited. 
from here we need to move the tasks to the different days the need to be completed by, and here we use the google calendar api to allocate our tasks a day. 
we should have crud funtionality on all the tasks that we have. When we need to have a funtionality that allows us to see all the tasks we have for a particular day eg monday.
we should also have a time needed to complete task option that allows us to get tasks of a particular day that take a particular amount of time to complete eg 1. short tasks or long tasks.
We will integrate this api with VUI i.e alexa
